          <h4>Overview</h4><br/>

          I am currently pursuing a Master's in Information Systems while my undergraduate degree is in Supply Chain Management.  As a result of this I have had professional experiences in both manufacturing and IT related fields.  Through these experiences I have found my true interests lie in how companies can leverage data and technology to drive efficiency and success.  To me a dataset is like a puzzle and as you start to put the pieces together you begin to write a story.  These are the stories I want to help write.<br/>
